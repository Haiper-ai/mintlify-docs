## Accessing the API
The API is only available for Haiper API users. You can access and manage your account on the [API page](https://haiper.ai/haiper-api).

## Content types
The Haiper API always accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. You will need to send the `content-type: application/json` header in requests.


## Authentication
All requests to the Haiper API must include `x-haiper-auth` and `authentication` header with your API key.

## Examples
All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
